# Lens: A Study Viewer

Lens is the evolution of [Cut](https://cut.social/), a platform that facilitates rapid development and deployment of interactive research instruments. Examples include: 

* [2-Alternative-Forced-Chocie Task](https://lens.cut.social/#/gonogo/en)
* [Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)](https://lens.cut.social/#/bart/en)
* [Stroop Task](https://lens.cut.social/#/stroop/en)
* [Ultiamtum Game](https://lens.cut.social/#/ultimatum/en)
* [Dictator Game](https://lens.cut.social/#/dictator/en)

\
Lens uses React and Material UI to structure the development process while simplifying the study design for experimenters and providing a streamlined experience to respondents. It works by sending users a JSON file containing the tasks and questions and collecting their responses in the same format. See the details [here](https://sites.google.com/view/msrad/cut?authuser=0). 

This architecture provides several other functionalities, in addition to facilitating the integration of interactive tasks with conventional survey elements:

* Multilingual survey content with little effort
* Device adaptable research instruments
* Texts formatting using Markdown

We obtained funding from the New School and the Association for Psychological Science (APS) to develop this tool. Research using this platform has been published in the *Journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin*:

* Rad, M. S., Ansarinia, M., & Shafir, E. (2023). Temporary self-deprivation can impair cognitive control: evidence from the Ramadan fast. Personality and social psychology bulletin, 49(3), 415-428. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211070385

And more is on the way! This is an ongoing project so your feedback and suggesitons would be much appreciated. Thanks! :)
